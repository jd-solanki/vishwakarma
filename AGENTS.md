## Project context

Before the first code action in a session: Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`, then invoke
`/project-context`.

`/project-context` holds this repository's words, rules, reasons and fences. Its table
says which references your task needs. Emit the triage line, then Read those.

## General Rules

- Do not manually edit files managed by CLI tools. E.g. skills-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yml, etc
- When creating .md file, if you find something can be visualized for reader's understanding do create visualization block using mermaid. This also applies to markdown supporting operations like GH issue or comments or form submissions which support markdown content
  - For GH issues & PR, also create this visualization block on top somewhere so they can easily understand via visualization
- **Git is the changelog.** Present tense only; no "used to" / "previously".
  - Exception - **Chesterton's Fence**: state the trap, not the timeline.
  - "`--no-folding` breaks `~/.agents`" = fence. "we tried it last week" = changelog.

## Core Engineering Principles

These apply to every change you make. They are not optional style preferences.

- **Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.**
- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.

## Prefer a Single Source of Truth

Do not duplicate knowledge that already has an authoritative source.

When a value, rule, configuration, or behavior is defined elsewhere, reference, import, or derive from that source instead of copying it. This applies to prose as much as to code — issues, PR descriptions, docs, and comments.

Examples:

- **Node.js version:** Do not hard-code the version in documentation, scripts, or CI if the repository already defines it in `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, or another canonical runtime configuration. Reference or read from that source instead.
- **pnpm version:** Do not repeat the pnpm version across documentation or tooling when it is already defined in `package.json`, such as through the `packageManager` field. Reference or derive it from there.
- Import a shared constant instead of redefining the same value in multiple modules.
- Read configuration from its canonical source instead of maintaining parallel copies.
- **Repository content quoted in prose:** When an issue, PR description, or doc refers to something that lives in the repository — a list in `README.md`, a set of supported options, a config schema — point the reader at that location instead of pasting the content. The pasted copy goes stale the moment the source changes, and readers then trust the wrong one. Write "see the supported providers list in `README.md`" instead of reproducing the list.

Before adding duplicated information, check whether a canonical source already exists. If it does, use that source.

Apply DRY to duplicated **knowledge**, not merely similar-looking code. Do not introduce abstractions solely to eliminate harmless code repetition when doing so would reduce clarity or increase coupling.
