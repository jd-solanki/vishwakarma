## The Truth About Comments

**Don't comment bad code -- rewrite it.** Comments are, at best, a necessary evil. The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourselves in code. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.

Comments lie. Not always, and not intentionally, but too often. Code changes and evolves; comments don't always follow. The older a comment is and the farther it is from the code it describes, the more likely it is to be wrong.

## Good Comments

Not all comments are bad. Some are necessary and valuable. Here are the types worth writing:

### Legal Comments

Copyright and license headers mandated by corporate or legal standards.

```java
// Copyright (c) 2024 Acme Corp. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
```

Keep them short. Reference a standard license file rather than embedding the full text.

### Informative Comments

Provide information that cannot be expressed in the code itself.

```java
// Format: kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
Pattern timeMatcher = Pattern.compile("\\d*:\\d*:\\d* \\w*, \\w* \\d*, \\d*");
```

Even here, a named constant or custom type could eliminate the need: `TIMESTAMP_PATTERN`.

### Explanation of Intent

Explain _why_ a decision was made, not _what_ the code does.

```python
# We sort by creation date descending because the business requirement
# specifies that the most recently created items appear first in the
# dashboard, even though alphabetical would be more intuitive.
items.sort(key=lambda x: x.created_at, reverse=True)
```

This is valuable because the _what_ is visible in the code, but the _why_ would otherwise be lost.

### Warning of Consequences

Alert other developers about consequences that are not obvious.

```java
// Don't run this test in CI -- it takes 45 minutes and requires
// a live connection to the production payment gateway
@Ignore("Long-running integration test requiring production access")
public void testLivePaymentGateway() { ... }
```

### TODO Comments

Mark work that needs to be done but cannot be done right now.

```python
# TODO(#1234): Replace with proper caching once Redis is provisioned
def get_user_preferences(user_id):
    return db.query(f"SELECT * FROM preferences WHERE user_id = {user_id}")
```

**Rules for TODOs:**

- Include a ticket number or issue reference
- Scan and resolve them regularly (they are not permanent)
- Never use TODO as an excuse to leave broken code
- IDE/linter plugins can track and report outstanding TODOs

### Amplification

Emphasize the importance of something that might otherwise seem inconsequential.

```java
String listItemContent = match.group(3).trim();
// The trim is critically important. It removes trailing whitespace
// that would cause the item to be recognized as another list.
new ListItemWidget(this, listItemContent, this.level + 1);
```

## Bad Comments

Most comments fall into these categories and should be eliminated:

### Mumbling

Comments written because "you should comment" rather than because they add value.

```java
// The processor
private Processor processor;

// Default constructor
public MyClass() { }
```

These say nothing. Delete them.

### Redundant Comments

Comments that take longer to read than the code they describe.

```java
// Returns the day of the month
public int getDayOfMonth() {
    return dayOfMonth;
}

// Check if the employee is eligible for benefits
if (employee.isEligibleForBenefits()) { ... }
```

The code already says exactly this. The comment is noise.

### Misleading Comments

Comments that are subtly incorrect -- the most dangerous kind.

```java
// Returns true if the user is active
public boolean isActive() {
    return lastLoginDate != null && !isDeleted && subscriptionEndDate.isAfter(now());
}
```

The comment says "active" means logged in before. The code checks three conditions. When the code changes and the comment doesn't, a future developer will be misled.

### Mandated Comments

Rules that require every function or variable to have a comment produce noise.

```java
/**
 * The name.
 * @param name The name.
 */
public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```

This adds no information. It's clutter that developers learn to ignore, which means they'll also ignore the few comments that actually matter.

### Journal Comments

Changelog entries at the top of files.

```java
// 2024-01-15 - Added validation for email format
// 2024-01-20 - Fixed bug in email regex
// 2024-02-01 - Added support for international emails
```

This is what version control is for. `git log` and `git blame` provide this information with more accuracy and context.

### Commented-Out Code

```python
# user_cache = {}
# def get_cached_user(user_id):
#     if user_id not in user_cache:
#         user_cache[user_id] = db.get_user(user_id)
#     return user_cache[user_id]

def get_user(user_id):
    return db.get_user(user_id)
```

Other developers are afraid to delete commented-out code because they think it must be there for a reason. It accumulates like barnacles. **Delete it.** Version control has perfect memory.

### Noise Comments

Comments that restate the obvious in a different form.

```java
/** Default constructor */
protected AnnualDateRule() { }

/** The day of the month */
private int dayOfMonth;

/** Returns the day of the month
 * @return the day of the month */
public int getDayOfMonth() { return dayOfMonth; }
```

Every one of these is noise. They provide no information, train developers to ignore comments, and create a false sense of documentation thoroughness.

### Position Markers and Banners

```java
// ========== PRIVATE METHODS ==========
// --- Validation ---
// /////// Constructor ///////
```

If your file is so large that you need position markers, the file is too large. Extract classes instead of adding banners.

### Closing Brace Comments

```java
if (condition) {
    while (running) {
        for (item : items) {
            // ... lots of code ...
        } // for
    } // while
} // if
```

If you need comments to track closing braces, your function is too long. Extract methods until the structure is obvious.

### Attribution Comments

```java
// Added by: john.smith@company.com
```

Version control tracks authorship more reliably. Use `git blame`.

## When Comments Are Truly Necessary

Despite the general advice to minimize comments, certain situations genuinely require them:

| Situation                          | Why code alone isn't enough           | Example                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Regulatory requirement**         | Law/compliance requires documentation | HIPAA, SOX, GDPR compliance notes                            |
| **Non-obvious performance choice** | Algorithm choice isn't self-evident   | "Using radix sort here because n > 10M and keys are bounded" |
| **External system quirk**          | Workaround for third-party bug        | "API returns 200 for errors; we check response body instead" |
| **Concurrency rationale**          | Threading decisions need explanation  | "Double-checked locking required here because..."            |
| **Domain formula**                 | Mathematical formula from spec        | "Amortization formula from IRS Publication 936"              |
| **Public API contract**            | Users cannot read implementation      | Javadoc for library interfaces                               |

The key: comments should explain _why_, never _what_. If you find yourself explaining _what_ the code does, the code needs to be clearer, not the comment.
